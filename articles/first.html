        <h1>The History of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h1>

        <!-- Placeholder image centered -->
        

        <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
        <p>
            Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inspired by the biological processes of the human visual cortex. The early work on CNNs dates back to the 1980s, with significant contributions from Kunihiko Fukushima, who developed the Neocognitron, a hierarchical, multilayered artificial neural network designed for visual pattern recognition.
        </p>

        <h2>Breakthroughs in the 1990s</h2>
        <p>
            The 1990s saw the development of LeNet-5, a pioneering CNN architecture by Yann LeCun and his colleagues. LeNet-5 was designed for handwritten digit recognition and demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks. This architecture laid the groundwork for modern CNNs.
        </p>

        <h2>The Deep Learning Revolution</h2>
        <p>
            The resurgence of CNNs began in the early 2010s with the advent of deep learning and the availability of large-scale datasets and powerful GPUs. In 2012, AlexNet, developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton, won the ImageNet competition with a substantial margin, showcasing the power of deep CNNs in image recognition.
        </p>

        <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
        <p>
            Since then, CNNs have evolved significantly with the introduction of architectures like VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet. These advancements have improved performance in various computer vision tasks and have expanded the applications of CNNs beyond image classification to include object detection, segmentation, and more.
